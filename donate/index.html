<h1 class="display-4">Donation</h1>

<div class="my-5">
  Captura is no longer under active maintainence and I'm no longer accepting donations.<br>
  Thank you to all who supported the project till now.<br>
  I gave up working on the project when I saw multiple people selling Captura as their own on Windows Store.<br>
  To see that someone's just stealing your work without any of their effort put in and selling it as their own really demotivates me from working on it.<br>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered shadow">
  {% for donation in site.data.donations %}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ donation.name }}</td>
      <td>{{ donation.amount }}</td>
    </tr>
  {% endfor %}
